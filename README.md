# Quickie
Generator tool for WASD.pt 

### Quick start:

```
npm i
npm start -or- node server.js

```

### Gulp

For CSS, the default task is `$ gulp`, which will run all the following commands. Or, you can use them individually as needed.

```
$ gulp build:css // only processes Sass to CSS once

$ gulp sass:watch // run Sass watcher for updated files

$ gulp build:dist // moves processed files from src/ to dist/
```

### Nice to have

- Responsive
- Connection with other API to create quickies, for example when its a game birthday
- Post directly to Instagram from editor mode
- Give more options to different layouts (Quote, VG Birthday, Giveaway)
- Maybe a app version with Electron 
- Archive page - DONE!
- Zoom in & Zoom out in Editor - DONE!
